### Profile
>Hello, my name is Sukhrob Abdunabiyev, today I am a student at the school of "software engineering" at the University of China. I am interested from school in various aspects of programming, such as robotics (Arduino), writing algorithms (C++) and creating applications (js[React,Node], C++) and others. In order to always meet the advanced standard and requirements, I am not delving into modern technology and new aspects of modern programming languages, as I consider it necessary to become a competitive specialist. Currently, I work as a frontend developer in a marketing company (create different information sites for customers, such as landing pages, etc.).I can also say that I am highly motivated and deformed.
***P.S. I am ready to do my utmost to pass this selection and become your partner.***
